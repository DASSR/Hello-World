# Hello-World
A general repository of ideas and dscussons
Hi, I am S R Das. I cannot describe which category I belong to in Computer learning; neither a student in the usual sense, nor a professional nor someone working in any computation related feld. In fact, I am a retired exective from banking, 66 years of age, now learning different areas of computing more out of curiosity than anything else. During last 6 years, since I retired I have taken up many computer science related courses from Coursera and Edx; besides courses on Mathemtics and Finance. Now I find, like many of you, topics of AI and Machine Learning very interesting and challenging. I plan to take up more serious study in these areas. Incidentally, I did a Masters degree in Mathematics long bak in the year 1973, which I now find useful in study of deep Learning. Thanks
